The preoperative stat dose of Augmentin 1.2g was administered.   The operating field was prepped with hibitane in alcohol by the operating sister H Makwala.   The pneumoperitoneum was established by the Veress needle inserted at Palmer’s point, then Optic entry supraumbilically. Ports 12x4, 5x2. The peritoneal cavity was entirely frozen. Extensive adhesiolysis.   Due to the remaining extensive adhesions in the infracolic area, the decision was made to perform sleeve gastrectomy. The liver was suspended with Pretzel liver retractor. The stomach was mobilized at the greater curvature and the cardia. Minor bleeding from the short gastric vessels were controlled with pressure.   Gastric sleeve was created with 60mmx4 45mmx1 tan and 60mmx1 purple linear cutters with Lembert V-lok90 3:0. The Large Gastric tube was used to size the gastric sleeve.
